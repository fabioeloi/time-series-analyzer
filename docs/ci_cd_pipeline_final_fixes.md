# CI/CD Pipeline Final Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the final set of fixes applied to stabilize the CI/CD pipeline.

## Issues Addressed

1.  **Deprecated GitHub Action (`actions/upload-artifact`)**:
    *   **Problem**: The pipeline was failing due to the use of `actions/upload-artifact@v3`, which is deprecated.
    *   **Solution**: Updated all instances of `actions/upload-artifact` in the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4`.

2.  **Backend Test Failure (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'infrastructure.cache'`)**:
    *   **Problem**: Backend unit tests were failing during the CI run because the `infrastructure.cache` module was missing. The `TimeSeriesService` attempts to import `cache_service` from this module.
    *   **Solution**:
        *   Created the `backend/infrastructure/cache/` directory.
        *   Added an `__init__.py` file to make it a Python package.
        *   Implemented a basic `InMemoryCacheService` in `backend/infrastructure/cache/cache_service.py`.
        *   Removed the generic `cache/` entry from `.gitignore` to allow the new module to be tracked by Git.

## Outcome

After these changes were implemented and pushed to the repository:
- The CI/CD pipeline now completes successfully for both frontend and backend components.
- All tests are passing.
- Artifacts are being uploaded correctly.

The project's CI/CD pipeline is now considered stable.
