# Backend Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the key fixes applied to resolve failing backend tests, resulting in all 50 tests passing.

## 1. API Tests - CSV Export (`test_export_csv_success`)

*   **Initial Problem:** A `FileNotFoundError` occurred when using FastAPI's `FileResponse` with temporary files for CSV export in `backend/main.py`.
*   **Solution:** The CSV export functionality in [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py) was modified. Instead of writing to a temporary file, the CSV data is now written to an in-memory `io.StringIO` buffer. The endpoint now returns a standard FastAPI `Response` with the `media_type="text/csv"`, ensuring the data is streamed correctly without relying on the filesystem for temporary storage.

## 2. Database Repository Tests (`tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py`)

### 2.1. `test_delete_time_series`

*   **Initial Problem:** Cascade delete operations were not functioning as expected with SQLite, leading to test failures.
*   **Solution:** The `db_session` fixture (commonly found in a conftest.py or the test file itself) was updated to execute `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` for SQLite database connections. This pragma enables foreign key constraint enforcement, including cascade deletes, for SQLite.

### 2.2. `test_save_data_points_timestamp_conversion`

*   **Initial Problem:** The test was failing due to an incorrect assertion when comparing Pandas Timestamps with Python datetime objects.
*   **Solution:** The assertion in [`test_save_data_points_timestamp_conversion`](tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py) within [`tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py`](tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py:1) was corrected to properly compare the datetime values, ensuring consistent type handling or using an appropriate comparison method.

### 2.3. `test_convert_to_time_series_empty_data` & `test_convert_to_time_series_missing_value_columns`

*   **Initial Problem:** These tests were encountering `sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet` errors. This typically indicates issues with SQLAlchemy's asynchronous operations or lazy loading in an environment where the async context is not properly managed.
*   **Solution:** The method for fetching metadata in these tests within [`tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py`](tests/backend/integration/test_time_series_db_repository.py:1) was changed to use eager loading. Specifically, queries were updated to use `select(...).options(selectinload(...)).where(...)`. This ensures that related data is loaded immediately with the main query, avoiding lazy loading attempts that were causing the `MissingGreenlet` errors.
