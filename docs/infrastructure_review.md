# Infrastructure Review: Time Series Analyzer

This review covers the infrastructure setup for the Time Series Analyzer project, focusing on the configuration located in the `infrastructure/` directory and incorporating clarifications regarding frontend deployment.

### 1. Main Technologies and Tools Used for Infrastructure

The project's infrastructure is primarily managed using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Key tools and services involved include:

*   **Terraform**: The core tool for defining, provisioning, and managing AWS resources.
*   **AWS CLI**: Used for interacting with AWS services, particularly for ECR authentication and ECS service updates within the deployment script.
*   **Docker**: Essential for building and packaging both the backend and frontend applications into container images.
*   **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: A fully managed Docker container registry for storing application images.
*   **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate**: A serverless compute engine for deploying and running Docker containers for the backend application.
*   **AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**: A managed relational database service used for persistent data storage, optimized for time-series data.
*   **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, primarily routing requests to the backend ECS service.
*   **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores and manages sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.
*   **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides monitoring and logging capabilities for the deployed applications and infrastructure.
*   **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where AWS resources are launched.
*   **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used for hosting the static frontend application files.
*   **AWS CloudFront**: A content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers the frontend content with low latency and high transfer speeds.
*   **Bash Scripting**: The `deploy.sh` script orchestrates the deployment process, combining Terraform, AWS CLI, and Docker commands.

### 2. Purpose of Key Infrastructure Files

*   **`infrastructure/main.tf`**: This is the main Terraform configuration file. It defines the AWS resources required for the backend application's deployment, including:
    *   VPC, public, and private subnets for network isolation.
    *   Internet Gateway and NAT Gateways for internet connectivity.
    *   Route tables and associations for network routing.
    *   Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for the ALB, backend ECS tasks, and the RDS database.
    *   RDS PostgreSQL instance with TimescaleDB support, including its subnet group and enhanced monitoring.
    *   IAM roles and policies for RDS monitoring and ECS task execution (including access to Secrets Manager).
    *   ECR repositories for backend and frontend Docker images.
    *   ECS Cluster, CloudWatch Log Group for ECS logs.
    *   Secrets Manager secrets for database credentials and API keys.
    *   Application Load Balancer (ALB) with listeners and target groups to expose the backend service.
    *   ECS Task Definition and Service for deploying the backend application.

*   **`infrastructure/variables.tf`**: This file defines input variables for the Terraform configuration. It allows for parameterizing the infrastructure deployment, making it reusable and configurable for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). Variables include AWS region, VPC CIDRs, database instance class, ECS CPU/memory, backend port, API key, and SSL configuration.

*   **`infrastructure/outputs.tf`**: This file defines output values from the Terraform deployment. These outputs provide important information after the infrastructure is provisioned, such as:
    *   ECR repository URLs for pushing Docker images.
    *   ALB DNS name for accessing the application.
    *   RDS PostgreSQL endpoint and connection details.
    *   ARNs of Secrets Manager secrets.
    *   VPC, subnet, ECS cluster, and security group IDs/names. These outputs are crucial for subsequent deployment steps (e.g., building and pushing Docker images, updating ECS services) and for external integrations.

*   **`infrastructure/deploy.sh`**: This Bash script automates the end-to-end deployment process for the backend infrastructure and application. Its key functions include:
    *   Checking for prerequisites (Terraform, AWS CLI, Docker).
    *   Initializing, validating, planning, and applying Terraform configurations.
    *   Building Docker images for both backend and frontend applications.
    *   Authenticating with ECR and pushing the built images.
    *   Updating the ECS service to deploy the new backend image.
    *   Providing options to deploy, destroy, plan, or validate the infrastructure.
    *   Displaying important post-deployment information like application URLs and log commands.

*   **`infrastructure/README.md`**: This comprehensive documentation provides an overview of the AWS infrastructure, its architecture, prerequisites, detailed deployment instructions, environment variables, monitoring guidelines, scaling options, troubleshooting tips, and security considerations. It serves as the primary guide for anyone interacting with the infrastructure.

*   **`docker-compose.yml`**: While not in the `infrastructure/` directory, this file is typically used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications locally. It would describe how the backend, frontend, and any other services (like a local database or Redis) interact during local development, providing a consistent development environment.

### 3. How the Infrastructure Supports Backend and Frontend Deployment and Operation

The infrastructure is designed to support the deployment and operation of both the backend and frontend components, although with different deployment mechanisms:

*   **Backend Deployment and Operation:**
    *   **Containerization**: The backend application is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across environments.
    *   **ECR**: Backend Docker images are stored in ECR, providing a secure and scalable registry.
    *   **ECS Fargate**: The backend is deployed as a serverless container service on ECS Fargate. This abstracts away server management, enabling automatic scaling and high availability.
    *   **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: The ALB acts as the entry point for API traffic, distributing requests to the backend ECS tasks. It also performs health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.
    *   **RDS PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB**: The backend connects to a dedicated, managed PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB extension enabled, providing robust and scalable data storage for time-series data.
    *   **Secrets Manager**: Sensitive configurations (database credentials, API key) are securely retrieved by ECS tasks from Secrets Manager, enhancing security.
    *   **CloudWatch**: Logs from the backend application running on ECS are automatically sent to CloudWatch, enabling centralized logging and monitoring.
    *   **VPC and Security Groups**: The backend ECS tasks and the RDS database are isolated within private subnets, with security groups strictly controlling network access, allowing only necessary communication (e.g., ALB to backend, backend to database).

*   **Frontend Deployment and Operation:**
    *   **Containerization**: The frontend application is also containerized, and its image is pushed to ECR.
    *   **S3 for Static Hosting**: The frontend application's static files are deployed to an AWS S3 bucket. S3 provides highly available and scalable storage for web assets.
    *   **CloudFront for Content Delivery**: CloudFront acts as a CDN, caching the frontend assets at edge locations globally. This significantly improves loading times for users and reduces the load on the S3 origin.
    *   **API Communication**: The frontend application, once loaded in the user's browser, communicates with the backend API via the ALB's public DNS name.

### 4. Overall Deployment Strategy

The overall deployment strategy is a hybrid approach combining Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with a shell-scripted orchestration layer and separate deployment mechanisms for backend and frontend:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**: All core AWS infrastructure components for the backend (VPC, subnets, security groups, RDS, ECS, ALB, ECR, Secrets Manager, IAM) are defined and managed declaratively using Terraform. This ensures repeatability, version control, and consistency of the infrastructure.
2.  **Automated Backend Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)**: A Bash script orchestrates the Terraform lifecycle (init, plan, apply) and integrates with Docker and AWS CLI to build application images, push them to ECR, and update the ECS service. This script streamlines the deployment process for the backend.
3.  **Container-based Deployment**: Both backend and frontend applications are containerized using Docker, promoting portability and consistent runtime environments.
4.  **Managed AWS Services**: The strategy heavily leverages AWS managed services (ECS Fargate, RDS, ALB, ECR, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, S3, CloudFront). This reduces operational overhead, provides built-in scalability, high availability, and security features.
5.  **Phased Deployment**: The infrastructure is provisioned first using Terraform. Once the infrastructure is in place, application images are built and pushed. Finally, the ECS service is updated to deploy the new backend image. The frontend deployment to S3/CloudFront is a separate, currently unautomated process.
6.  **Separation of Concerns**: The backend and frontend are deployed and managed somewhat independently. The backend is a dynamic containerized service, while the frontend is a static web application served via CDN.
